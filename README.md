Crime Data for all states and union territories of India.
Firstly, I used Pivot Table on the raw data to summarise the district values for all states and union territories (Clean Data sheet).
Then I calculated basic Statistics for all the variables- Sum of Rape, Sum of Kidnapping and Abduction, Sum of Dowry Deaths, Sum of Importation of Girls, Sum of Cruelty by Husband or his Relatives, Sum of Insult to modesty of Women, Sum of Assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty (Descriptive Statistics sheet).
I also created Pareto Charts for each variable to visualize the distribution and generated box plots to identify outliers and understand the spread of the data.
I created a correlation matrix to understand relationships between variables and scatter plots to visualize these relationships between the variables. Here "Rape" and "Assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty" are highly correlated.
Uttar Pradesh has the highest number of crime case followed by Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. Least number of cases belongs to Lakshadweep.
